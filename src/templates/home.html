        This is a tool used to generate schedules given a list of courses. 
        On the editor screen, you'll be asked to enter some information on 
        each course. Submit as many as you need, and when you're done adding 
        new courses, click "Done". 
    </p>
    <p class="home__text">
        Now, you will be able to cycle through all the generated schedules. 
        These schedules are generally going to have too many courses, but 
        note that removing any course from a schedule produces another 
        valid schedule.
