# schedule-generator

[Live version here](https://zyrrus.pythonanywhere.com)

I built this project to help me schedule classes every semester. I usually have a large list of classes that I need to take, so when it comes time to schedule, I enter all the class information, and then start generating potential schedules.

I spent a lot of time fighting with the complexity of the algorithm because I wanted a nearly unnoticeable load time. In the end, I was pretty satisfied with how I achieved that goal.
